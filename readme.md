#Publications
   For more detialed analysis of entropy fluctuations in isolated quantum please
   refer to the following publications:
   * [Extreme fluctuations of entropies in quantum systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07083)
   * [How much entanglement can be created in a closed system?](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.101.060401)
   
## Resources
   Here are some of the resources we made use of in developing this project:
   * [Quantum coarse-grained entropy and thermalization in closed systems](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.99.012103)
